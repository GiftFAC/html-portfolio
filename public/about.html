<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I am Sanusi Hadiatillah Oyediran, an enthusiastic and growing computer science graduate with a passion for technology, creativity and problem-solving. I recently began my journey into web design, and I’m steadily building skills in HTML, CSS, and other foundational tools. I enjoy creating clean, simple, and functional designs that help people interact with technology more easily. </p>

<p> I am the type of person who is never afraid to step into new territories, even when I’m not yet fully solid in them. I learn quickly, ask questions, and stay committed until I understand what I’m working on. Whether it is a new framework, a new programming language, or a challenging project, I always approach it with curiosity, determination, and a positive mindset. </p>

<p> As I continue my web design journey, I’m also preparing to expand into Python programming, especially for data-related and backend development. I believe combining web design skills with strong programming capabilities will allow me to build more complete and impactful digital solutions. I am excited about my growth, open to learning, and ready to explore every opportunity that helps me improve. </p>
